**_Therefore by their fruits you will know them. - Matthew 7:20 (NKJV)_**

That verse from the Bible is the foundation of this project.
It's emphasis is on relying on the outward results to determine who or what a thing or person is.

So, here is the background:
Africa is always mentioned as being mineral-rich. Several cities are described as major and investment hubs. Other cities are hailed as equals with international cities. But, does the data tell the same story
of these African nations?

The problem statement comes from trying to test the following hypothesis. And answering the following questions.

## Problem Statement & Hypothesis
The **United Nations Geoscheme** divides the world into regions and sub-regions. 

This assignment is for statistical convenience and does not imply any assumption regarding political or other affiliation of countries or territories.

Africa has 5 regions:

1. Northern Africa - 6 nations
2. West Africa - 16 nations
3. Central Africa - 9 nations
4. East Africa - 18 nations
5. Southern Africa -5 nations

- Each of these regions has their leading nation: "_the largest nation, especially economically_". 
- It appears that some of these leading nations are ‘_dying_’ in real time. 
- Do the characteristics of the leading nations in each region reflect the general characteristics of each of the other region nations?
- Is the leading nation in each of these regions failing? (relative to the neighbouring nations in each region)
- Is there a #2 nation in each region gearing up to take that place?

## Analysis Points
